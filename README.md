# Java QAP3 StepBad SD12 Project

## Overview
This project is a Java-based application that demonstrates object-oriented programming principles, including class inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It includes implementations of various shapes, movable points, and personal data structures.

## Features
- **Geometric Shapes**: Classes like `Circle`, `Ellipse`, `EquilateralTriangle`, and `Shape` define various geometric entities.
- **Personal Data**: `Person` and `CollegeStudent` classes manage individual and student information.
- **Movable Objects**: `MovablePoint` and `Point` classes handle point-based movement.
- **Demo Files**: Several `Demo.java` files provide sample usage of the classes.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Open the project in an IDE (IntelliJ IDEA, VS Code, etc.).
3. Compile the Java files using:
   ```sh
   javac *.java
   ```
